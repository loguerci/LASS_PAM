## Abstract

Over the past several years, significant progress has been made in Music Source Separation (MSS). From the vibration of musical instruments to the audio signal present in a finalized recording, numerous factors come into play. These include the acoustic radiation of the instrument, the movements associated with musical performance, the room’s response to a moving acoustic source, the microphone array configuration, and finally the transformations applied during post-production. Due to the complexity and variability of these factors, establishing a new state-of-the-art approach remains challenging.
From this perspective, the objective of source separation is to design algorithms capable of virtually reversing this entire chain of transformations and mixing processes in order to estimate the signal produced by each individual musical instrument. This can be achieved by incorporating prior knowledge about the structure of the source signals as well as the nature of the transformations they have undergone. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid source separation pipeline, using a CLAP Language-Queried Audio Source Separation (CLASS) as prior to the initialization of Fast Multi-channel Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (FastMNMF) algorithm.
